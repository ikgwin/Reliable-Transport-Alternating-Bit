# Reliable-Transport-Alternating-Bit
Implementation of the Alternating Bit Protocol for reliable transport simulation. This repository contains C code adapted from the alternating bit and Go-Back-N network emulator by J.F. Kurose, modified to demonstrate reliable data transfer using alternating bit protocol.
